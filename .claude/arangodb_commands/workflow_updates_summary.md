# Workflow.md Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated the workflow.md file to replace all non-existent agent analytical commands with working alternatives.

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Non-Existent Agent Commands
The following non-existent `python -m arangodb.cli.agent` commands were replaced:

#### Search & Analysis Commands
- `combine-search-results` → Replaced with jq command to merge JSON results
- `extract-topics` → Replaced with basic text analysis using Unix tools
- `summarize-context` → Replaced with jq to combine JSON files
- `analyze-topics` → Replaced with metadata extraction and frequency analysis
- `analyze-conversations` → Replaced with user interaction counting

#### Entity & Relationship Commands  
- `extract-and-link` → Replaced with manual entity creation and graph commands
- `find-patterns` → Replaced with frequency analysis using jq
- `update-relationships` → Replaced with manual graph add commands
- `detect-topics` → Replaced with tag frequency analysis

#### Embedding & Optimization Commands
- `generate-embeddings` → Noted that embeddings are auto-generated on memory creation
- `optimize-embeddings` → Noted that external ML tools are needed for dimension reduction
- `analyze-slow-queries` → Directed to ArangoDB's built-in profiler
- `compare-performance` → Replaced with jq-based JSON comparison

#### Maintenance Commands
- `backup` → Replaced with arangodump (ArangoDB's native backup tool)
- `clean-orphans` → Replaced with AQL query example
- `merge-duplicates` → Replaced with duplicate detection and manual merge
- `optimize-graph` → Replaced with AQL query examples
- `maintenance-report` → Replaced with shell script to gather statistics

#### Monitoring & Reporting Commands
- `monitor` → Replaced with periodic polling loop
- `generate-insights` → Replaced with visualization commands
- `learning-report` → Replaced with basic statistics gathering

### 2. Key Principles Applied

1. **External Tools**: Where analytical capabilities are needed, pointed to external NLP/ML tools
2. **Unix Tools**: Used standard Unix tools (jq, awk, sort, uniq) for basic analysis
3. **Native ArangoDB**: Used ArangoDB's native tools (arangodump, AQL) where appropriate
4. **Manual Processes**: Documented manual approaches for complex operations
5. **Existing CLI**: Leveraged existing CLI commands where possible

### 3. Actual Working Agent Commands
The only agent commands that actually exist are:
- `process-message` - For Marker communication
- `send-message` - For Marker communication  
- `claude-code-for-marker` - For Marker integration

All analytical functions have been replaced with appropriate alternatives that users can actually execute.
