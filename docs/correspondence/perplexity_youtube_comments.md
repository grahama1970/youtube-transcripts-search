Yes, **the YouTube Data API allows you to search, retrieve, and process comments** from YouTube videos, but not in the same way as searching transcripts or captions. Hereâ€™s how it works and what you can do:

## How to Access YouTube Comments via the API

### 1. **Retrieve Comments for a Video**
You can use the [`commentThreads.list`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads/list) endpoint to retrieve the top-level comments (and replies) for a specific video.

**Python Example:**
```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

api_key = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
video_id = "qD-Nniey5TM"

youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)

request = youtube.commentThreads().list(
    part="snippet",
    videoId=video_id,
    maxResults=100,  # Max per page
    textFormat="plainText"
)
response = request.execute()

for item in response['items']:
    comment = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['textDisplay']
    print(comment)
```
- This will print the first 100 top-level comments on the video.

### 2. **Searching Within Comments**
**The YouTube API does not support full-text search across all comments for a video.**  
If you want to "search" for specific text in comments, you must:
- Retrieve all comments (using pagination).
- Filter/search the text in your own code.

**Example:**
```python
search_term = "great video"
for item in response['items']:
    comment = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['textDisplay']
    if search_term.lower() in comment.lower():
        print(comment)
```

---

### 3. **Limitations**
- **Rate Limits:** The YouTube Data API has quotas; retrieving many comments can use up your quota quickly.
- **Replies:** You can also fetch replies to comments using the `comments.list` endpoint with a `parentId`.
- **API Key:** You need a valid YouTube Data API v3 key.

## **Summary Table**

| Can You...                  | With YouTube API? | How?                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Get all comments on video   | Yes               | `commentThreads.list` endpoint      |
| Search for text in comments | No (not directly) | Download comments, search yourself  |
| Get replies to comments     | Yes               | `comments.list` with `parentId`     |

**In summary:**  
You can fetch all comments for a video using the YouTube API, but you must search/filter them yourself in your code. The API does not provide a built-in comment search function.
