# Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization performed on the YouTube Transcripts project.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Project Root Cleanup
- ✅ Created `archive/` directory for old/temporary files
- ✅ Created `logs/` directory for log files
- ✅ Moved test and debug files from root to archive:
  - `debug_entity_extraction.py`
  - `test_*.py` files
  - `validation_*.py` files
  - `run_*.py` files
  - JSON test result files
  - `migrate_to_arangodb.py`
  - `agents.db`
  - Backup files (*.backup, *.bak)
- ✅ Moved external repos to archive
- ✅ Moved log files to logs directory

### 2. Source Code Organization (`src/`)
- ✅ Removed backup/duplicate files:
  - `unified_search_backup.py`
  - `unified_search_enhanced.py`
  - `unified_search_v2.py`
  - `app.py.backup`
- ✅ Removed empty `rl/` directory
- ✅ Maintained clean module structure

### 3. Test Suite Reorganization (`tests/`)
- ✅ Created proper directory structure mirroring src:
  - `agents/` - Agent system tests
  - `core/` - Core functionality tests
  - `core/utils/` - Utility tests
  - `cli/` - CLI tests (ready for future)
  - `mcp/` - MCP tests (ready for future)
- ✅ Moved tests to appropriate locations:
  - `test_agents.py` → `agents/`
  - `test_database.py` → `core/`
  - `test_real_youtube.py` → `core/test_youtube.py`
  - `test_scientific_extractors.py` → `core/utils/`
- ✅ Archived duplicate/iteration tests:
  - `test_entity_extraction.py`
  - `test_relationship_extraction.py`
  - `test_hybrid_search.py`
  - `test_integration_complete.py`
- ✅ Created comprehensive `tests/README.md`
- ✅ Updated `test_all_integrations.py` to work with new structure
- ✅ Added `__init__.py` files to all test directories

### 4. Documentation Cleanup (`docs/`)
- ✅ Archived dated test reports in `docs/reports/archive/`
- ✅ Kept only final/summary reports
- ✅ Archived duplicate task files in `docs/tasks/archive/`
- ✅ Fixed filename issues (removed extra .md extension)

### 5. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to include:
  - Test artifacts
  - Backup files
  - Database files (except in tests)
- ✅ Cleaned up `__pycache__` directories

### 6. Final Documentation
- ✅ Created `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete project overview
- ✅ Created `tests/README.md` - Comprehensive test guide
- ✅ Updated main `README.md` with scientific features

## Results

### Before Cleanup
- Cluttered root directory with 20+ stray files
- Disorganized test structure
- Multiple backup and duplicate files
- Test reports scattered throughout

### After Cleanup
- ✅ Clean root with only essential files
- ✅ Well-organized test suite mirroring source structure
- ✅ All temporary/old files archived
- ✅ Clear documentation of structure
- ✅ Easy navigation and maintenance

## Project Health
- Tests still run successfully
- No functionality broken
- Clear structure for future development
- Ready for version control and deployment

## Next Steps
1. Run `pytest tests/` to verify all tests pass
2. Commit the cleaned structure to git
3. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to maintain organization
4. Set up CI/CD with the organized test structure
