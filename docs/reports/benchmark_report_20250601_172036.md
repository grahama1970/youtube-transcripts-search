## Analysis

### Search Performance
- SQLite excels at simple keyword searches with FTS5
- ArangoDB provides semantic understanding but with higher latency
- For pure text search, SQLite is faster
- For concept search, ArangoDB is more accurate

### Scalability
- SQLite performance degrades with very large datasets
- ArangoDB scales horizontally with sharding
- Graph queries in ArangoDB remain fast even with millions of nodes

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | SQLite | ArangoDB |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Setup Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Search Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Search Quality | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Recommendations

1. **Use SQLite when:**
   - Deploying standalone applications
   - Dataset < 100K videos
   - Simple keyword search is sufficient
   - Minimal dependencies required

2. **Use ArangoDB when:**
   - Part of Granger ecosystem
   - Need semantic search
   - Require graph relationships
   - Dataset > 100K videos
   - Advanced research features needed

## Conclusion

Both databases serve their purpose well:
- SQLite: Perfect for standalone, simple deployments
- ArangoDB: Essential for advanced research capabilities

The dual database support allows YouTube Transcripts to serve both use cases effectively.
