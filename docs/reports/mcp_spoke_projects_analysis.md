## Key Findings

### 1. MCP Implementation Status
- **All 10 projects have MCP implementations** - This shows excellent integration readiness
- Projects use either dedicated MCP directories or integrate MCP servers in their CLI modules
- Consistent use of `slash_mcp_mixin.py` pattern across multiple projects

### 2. Project Categories by Function

#### Research & Analysis
- DARPA Crawl - Funding opportunities
- ArXiv MCP Server - Academic papers
- SPARTA - Cybersecurity resources

#### Code & Development
- GitGet - Repository analysis
- Aider-Daemon - AI pair programming
- Unsloth - Model fine-tuning

#### Data Processing
- Marker - Document extraction
- MCP Screenshot - Visual capture

#### Infrastructure
- ArangoDB - Knowledge storage
- Claude Max Proxy - LLM orchestration

### 3. Integration Patterns

The projects show clear integration patterns:
- **Data Flow**: SPARTA → Marker → ArangoDB → Unsloth
- **LLM Orchestration**: Claude Max Proxy serves as the universal interface
- **Research Pipeline**: ArXiv/DARPA → ArangoDB → Analysis tools

## Recommendations for Prompt Categories

### Primary Categories
1. **research** - ArXiv, DARPA Crawl, SPARTA
2. **code** - GitGet, Aider-Daemon
3. **documents** - Marker, MCP Screenshot
4. **data** - ArangoDB, SPARTA
5. **models** - Unsloth, Claude Max Proxy

### Secondary Categories
1. **analysis** - All projects have analysis capabilities
2. **automation** - Strong automation focus across projects
3. **integration** - Projects designed to work together
4. **knowledge** - Knowledge management is central
5. **development** - Development tools and workflows

### Usage-Based Categories
1. **daily-workflow** - Regular research and development tasks
2. **batch-processing** - Large-scale data operations
3. **real-time** - Interactive development and analysis
4. **pipeline** - End-to-end processing workflows

## Conclusion

The Granger ecosystem represents a sophisticated suite of AI-powered tools with excellent MCP integration. The projects are designed to work together in various pipelines, with clear data flow patterns and complementary capabilities. The consistent MCP implementation across all projects enables seamless orchestration through tools like the Claude Module Communicator.

For prompt organization, a hierarchical approach would work best:
- **Top Level**: Primary function (research, code, documents, etc.)
- **Second Level**: Specific capability (extraction, analysis, generation)
- **Third Level**: Integration patterns (standalone, pipeline, collaborative)

This structure would make it easy for users to find the right prompts while also discovering powerful tool combinations.
