# Claude Test Reporter Integration Report

Generated: 2025-06-03 11:03

## Summary

The claude-test-reporter is a pytest plugin that provides test reporting capabilities for the Granger ecosystem. After investigation, we discovered and resolved integration issues.

## Key Findings

### 1. Plugin Configuration
The claude-test-reporter is properly configured as a pytest plugin via entry points:
```toml
[project.entry-points.pytest11]
claude_test_reporter = "claude_test_reporter.pytest_plugin"
```

### 2. Command-Line Options
The correct command-line options for claude-test-reporter are:
- `--claude-reporter` - Enable the reporter (required)
- `--claude-model=MODEL_NAME` - Specify the model/project name
- `--claude-output-dir=DIR` - Specify output directory (default: test_reports)

### 3. Initial Issue
The pytest_plugin.py file was not included in the installed package, causing the plugin to not load. This was resolved by reinstalling from source in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e /home/graham/workspace/experiments/claude-test-reporter --force-reinstall
```

### 4. Usage Example
```bash
# Run tests with claude-test-reporter
pytest tests/test_file.py --claude-reporter --claude-model=project-name --claude-output-dir=test_reports -v

# The report will be saved to: test_reports/project-name_test_report.txt
```

### 5. Report Format
The current implementation generates a simple text report with:
- Total test count
- Pass/fail counts
- Success rate percentage
- List of failed tests with error details

## Recommendations

1. **PYTHONPATH Issue**: The test failures indicate PYTHONPATH needs to be set:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=./src:$PYTHONPATH
   ```

2. **Enhanced Reporting**: The current reporter generates basic text reports. For markdown reports as specified in CLAUDE.md, additional implementation may be needed.

3. **Integration with Test Suite**: Add the claude-reporter options to your test scripts:
   ```bash
   pytest --claude-reporter --claude-model=youtube-transcripts --claude-output-dir=docs/reports
   ```

## Verification

The plugin is now properly loaded as shown in pytest's plugin list:
```
plugins: metadata-3.1.1, claude-test-reporter-0.2.1, cov-6.1.1, ...
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix import issues in test files by ensuring PYTHONPATH is set correctly
2. Consider enhancing the reporter to generate markdown tables as specified in CLAUDE.md
3. Add the reporter options to your standard test commands
