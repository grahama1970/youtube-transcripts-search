## Recommendations

1. **Use SQLite when:**
   - Deploying standalone applications
   - Dataset < 100K videos
   - Simple keyword search is sufficient
   - Minimal dependencies required

2. **Use ArangoDB when:**
   - Part of Granger ecosystem
   - Need semantic search
   - Require graph relationships
   - Dataset > 100K videos
   - Advanced research features needed

## Conclusion

Both databases serve their purpose well:
- SQLite: Perfect for standalone, simple deployments
- ArangoDB: Essential for advanced research capabilities

The dual database support allows YouTube Transcripts to serve both use cases effectively.
